I made the site responsive using media queries for screen widths of 1024px, 768px, and 480px. the font sizes, spacing, and layout adjust based on screen size. The navigation turns vertical on smaller screens, and the hero section and get smaller to ajdust. Images and form elements use flexible widths to fit all devices.
